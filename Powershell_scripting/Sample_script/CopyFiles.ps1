#Create a function named CheckFolder that checks for the existence of a specific directory/folder that is passed 
#to it as a parameter. Also, include a switch parameter named create. If the directory/folder does not exist and 
#the create switch is specified, a new folder should be created using the name of the folder/directory that was 
#passed to the function.

#Create a function named DisplayFolderStatistics to display folder statistics for a directory/path that is passed 
#to it. Output should include the name of the folder, number of files in the folder, and total size of all files in 
#that directory.

#b) Test for the existence of the destination folder; create it if it is not found (using the CheckFolder function

#c) Copy each file to the appropriate destination.
#get all the files that need to be copied

#c-i) Display a message when copying a file. The message should list where the file is being
#moved from and where it is being moved to.

#d) Display each target folder name with the file count and byte count for each folder.
